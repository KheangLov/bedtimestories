            <h2 class="join-header">The Bedtime Story Format</h2>
            <p class="join-text">
              We created a slightly different story format for our Bedtime Stories to provide the best experience for parents and make it as easy as possible to tell the stories in your own words.
            </p>
            <p class="join-text">
              There are two core concepts that are important: Story Worlds & Story Views. A Story World simply is a collection of stories that share the same setting, characters and basic themes. For example a little knight that heads out into different adventures – each story will be different, but the little knight, his friends and the overall setting is familiar.
            </p>
            <p class="join-text">
              Each Story World contains bundles of five stories – so within Bedtime Stories there are no single stories, they always come in bundles of five.

            <h2 class="join-header">Author Royalties</h2>
            <p class="join-text">
              Stories are the core of this app and we are working very closely with our authors. Not only do we want the authors to be visible within the app & help them share their vision with the parents, we also strive to provide fair compensation for the work.
            </p>
            <p class="join-text">
              The royalty system is based on a net revenue share for sold story bundles – we’ve prepared detailed overviews and projections so you can see the specifics of the royalty model – just drop us a line and we’ll send you the details.
